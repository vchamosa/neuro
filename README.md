Data analysis scripts from my research at the University of Edinburgh. They were designed to explore various metrics of animal behaviour in a go/no-go task under control and experimental conditions.
They've been pushed to this repository to be kept as a record.

These scripts are my own, though some sections have been inspired by colleagues' work. Any scripts that were adapted to my needs but mostly written by others have been omitted. Because several of these scripts are part of larger pipelines and are designed to run on data that will not be made available, they may not work for you. If you're interested in adapting any of them for your own purposes, please contact me first.
